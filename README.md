# Control_Device_Board
This board will be designed to control 12 devices base on Arduino controller unit

This board was design for controlling 12 devices, where:
   - 8 devices can ON/OFF AC load
   - 4 devices can ON/OFF DC load (maximum 12VDC)

Board was based on Arduino Nano schematic with ATmega328P microcontroller
and display the status on LCD 16x2.

This is schematic:
